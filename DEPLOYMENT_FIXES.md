# Deployment Fixes for Render

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **Port Configuration Issue** ✅
**Problem**: The app was using `FLASK_PORT` instead of `PORT` environment variable that Render provides.
**Fix**: Updated `app.py` to use `PORT` environment variable with proper fallback:
```python
port = int(os.getenv('PORT', os.getenv('FLASK_PORT', '5000')))
```

### 2. **Static File Serving** ✅
**Problem**: Flask doesn't serve static files properly in production mode by default.
**Fixes**:
- Added `send_from_directory` import
- Added explicit static file route handler
- Added favicon handler to prevent 404 errors
- Set proper cache headers for static files

### 3. **File Persistence** ✅
**Problem**: Render's filesystem is ephemeral, so `game_scores.json` would be lost on restart.
**Fixes**:
- Added robust error handling for file operations
- Made scores file location configurable via environment variable
- Added atomic file writes with temporary files
- Graceful fallback when filesystem is read-only
- Application continues to work even if scores can't be persisted

### 4. **Gunicorn Configuration** ✅
**Problem**: Basic gunicorn command might timeout or have performance issues.
**Fixes**:
- Updated `render.yaml` with optimized gunicorn settings:
  - Single worker (sufficient for free tier)
  - 2 threads for concurrency
  - 120 second timeout for AI requests
  - Info log level for debugging
- Updated `Procfile` with same configuration

### 5. **Python Version Specification** ✅
**Added**: `runtime.txt` file specifying Python 3.11.9 for consistent deployment

### 6. **Environment Variable Configuration** ✅
**Added** to `render.yaml`:
- `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` for proper logging

## Files Modified/Created

1. **app.py**
   - Fixed port configuration
   - Added static file serving routes
   - Improved file handling with error recovery
   - Added favicon handler

2. **render.yaml**
   - Optimized gunicorn configuration
   - Added PYTHONUNBUFFERED environment variable

3. **Procfile**
   - Updated with optimized gunicorn settings

4. **runtime.txt** (new)
   - Specifies Python version

5. **test_deployment.py** (new)
   - Comprehensive deployment testing script

## Deployment Steps

1. **Commit changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix deployment issues for Render"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy on Render**:
   - Go to https://render.com
   - Create new Web Service
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Render will auto-detect the configuration

3. **Set Environment Variables** (in Render dashboard):
   - `GEMINI_API_KEY` (optional, for AI features)

## Key Improvements

- ✅ Works without Gemini API key (uses fallback responses)
- ✅ Handles read-only filesystems gracefully
- ✅ Proper static file serving in production
- ✅ Optimized for Render's free tier
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Health check endpoint at `/health`

## Testing

Run the deployment test locally:
```bash
python test_deployment.py
```

This validates:
- Environment configuration
- Dependencies
- File structure
- App import
- Score file handling

## Notes

- Scores won't persist between deployments on Render's free tier
- For persistent scores, consider using a database service
- The game works perfectly without score persistence
- AI features work in fallback mode without API key
